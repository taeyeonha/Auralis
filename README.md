# Auralis

A music generation ML model with a focus on Lo-Fi music (INCOMPLETE/STILL IN THE WORKS).

## Description

Using Tensorflow LSTMs and Sequential layers, I tried making a Deep Learning model that will generate Lo-Fi music given snippets of training examples.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Python 3.x
Install following packages using pip:
- Music21
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- glob

### Training/Generating Music

1. Download the folder containing Lo-Fi midi snippets (or any midi files of your choice)
2. To train the model, you simply just run each code cell in model.ipynb and run the last cell to generate music

# Next Steps

I will probably look at papers/articles related to music generation to try and improve this model, as it is still in it's preliminary stages right now.
